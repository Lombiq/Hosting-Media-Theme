# Lombiq Hosting - Media Theme - Test Theme

A theme only used for testing that demonstrates the local development version of a Media Theme.

Media Themes are used in two distinct modes:

- As a standard theme during local development.
- From the Media folder when deployed.

We need to test both cases. This project tests the standard theme scenario while the sample in `Lombiq.Hosting.MediaTheme` provides the content for testing the deployed scenario.
